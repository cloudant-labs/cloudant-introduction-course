Welcome to the Introduction to Cloudant course, an eighteen part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant databases-as-a-service.



This is part 7: "HTTP API Basics".

In the previous part we saw the Cloudant dashboard which is a web app that is making HTTP calls to Cloudant's API. In this step we'll be using the command line to make HTTP requests and to try to add/edit/delete some documents from there.

It's worth understanding the HTTP API from first principles even if you intend to use the higher-level client libraries.



The advantage of a database having an HTTP API is that any device on the internet can read/write data if you want it to. No special software is required. No drivers speaking a custom protocol. Just an standard HTTP library. Everything speaks HTTP:

web browser
any programming language
command-line scripting tools like curl
mobile devices
We're going to learn the API using curl, a free, open-source command-line tool that can dispatch HTTP requests. curl comes pre-installed on most Macs and Unix-like operating systems. If it's not present on your computer, google "curl" and follow the installation instructions.



Let's first use curl to fetch a web page - Google's homepage.

In a command-line terminal type "curl https://www.google.com"

You should get a pageful of HTML in reply.

If this works, then you have curl installed and you can proceed with the next tasks.



Now we don't want to type the URL of our Cloudant service every time so let's save the Cloudant URL in an environment variable called URL.

export URL= creates a variable called URL which we can access later.

export URL="https://username:password@host"
Furthermore, we can create an "alias" (a shortcut) called "acurl" which saves us further typing. This "acurl" command is an alias for curl but with the JSON content-type header and a couple of useful commmand-line switches.

alias acurl="curl -sgH 'Content-type: application/json'" 
We can test it by fetching "acurl $URL/" and we should get some JSON back from Cloudant.

Congratulations! You've just made your first Cloudant API call.



Now our acurl alias is set up, we can start exploring the API. Let's start with the _all_dbs endpoint which returns a list of databases.

Type acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.

A quick note here on formatting JSON on the command-line. We can send the output of our acurl command to another tool which will format the data nicely on the terminal. There are are couple of options:

jq available from the URL on screen which is more than just a JSON formatter - it allows JSON to be parsed, queried and manipulated too.
or python -m json.tool is a simple JSON formatter, if you happen to have Python installed on your computer.
So acurl $URL/_all_dbs | jq means "pipe the output of acurl into jq" and what you see should be a nicely formatted, coloured output.



The Cloudant API paths are hierarchical with the top level giving you information about the service and then each database sits at a level below that.

So acurl $URL/books gives us information about the books database we created earlier.

You should see information about how many documents it has, how many deleted documents and how much disk space it's occupying.

Note: don't forget to pipe the output to jq or python to get a prettier output.



If we want to see the documents contained in the database we can use the _all_docs endpoint.

So acurl $URL/books/_all_docs means get all the documents from the books database from the Cloudant service at the supplied URL.

This will return you a list of _id and _rev values for each document. If you want the document bodies too, then add ?include_docs=true to your API call.



If we want to fetch a single document back from the database, then documents sit one level below the database in the hierarchy of the URL.

So acurl $URL/books/id means get get document id from the database books from the Cloudant service at the supplied URL.

Notice the hierarchy: service / database / document



So far we've only used the "GET" HTTP method, which is the default one for curl and the one used when you enter a URL into your web browser.

Cloudant's API often uses the HTTP method as a "verb" to describe the action being asked of the database: GET for fetching data.

With curl we can specify the method we want to use with the -X command-line option.



So to write a new document to our books database using the API, we're going to use the POST method, massing a document as the body of the HTTP request.

acurl -X POST specifies we're using the POST HTTP method. -d specifies the document we want to write, which is sent as the body of the request and finally the URL we are writing to which is $URL/books - the books database.

Alternatively we can use the PUT method, if we are supplying the id of the document being written. The URL becomes "$URL/books/" followed by the id we wish to write.

Both write methods yield identical response. ok: true to show that the write was successful. id being the document id written and rev being the revision token that was generated by the database.



To modify a document we can use the PUT method, writing the new body to the URL that points to the document id we wish to overwrite. -d supplies the new document body and the URL not only contains the database and id of the document, but critically the rev - the revision of the document we intend to mutate.

If we forget and omit the rev parameter we will get an error response.

Note: HTTP response codes tell you whether a request succeed or not. Responses in the 200 range are successful, 400s are user errors (e.g. invalid parameters) and 500s are server-side errors. You can see the full HTTP request and response by additionally supplying the -v command-line option to curl/acurl.

Also note that updates to documents happen in their entirety or not at all, there's no API construct to modify part of a document. A whole document must be supplied to overwrite a previous revision.



Finally to delete a document we use the DELETE method, so -X DELETE. We direct the request to the URL that includes the database name and document to be deleted, and critically we also supply the rev - the revision of the document to delete.

If we omit the revision token, an error is returned and the request fails.



To summarise:

Understanding the HTTP API helps you grasp the relationship between your code and the Cloudant service.

The URLS are hierarchical: service/database/document or service/database/endpoint

The HTTP methods act as "verbs" defining the action to be done.

All actions can be triggered using simple HTTP API calls, from the command-line or from your code and so can be easily scripted.



That's the end of this part. The next part is called "The Bulk API"
